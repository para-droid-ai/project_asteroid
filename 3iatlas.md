# 3I/ATLAS Narrative Inspiration

This file serves as a source of inspiration and thematic guidance for the game's narrative, centered around the concept of a long-journey interstellar object, similar to 3I/ATLAS.

The core idea is that the colony exists on a "manx" comet (a rocky, asteroid-like object with a long-period tail) that has been traveling through interstellar space for eons. The AI overseer (the in-game narrator) is a form of "last alert system" or "ark" activated as the object re-enters a solar system, deploying a human contingent as a survival trial.
